                    <p>Game of Thrones is an extremely popular television show based off books by author George R. R. Martin.
                        It took the entire world by storm when it aired in April 2011 and would continue to thrive through the
                        decade up to its finale which aired on May 2019. <br/><br/>
                        Season 1 averaged <span class="highlight">9.3 million viewers</span>, and by season 8 the show was pulling in
                        an average of <span class="highlight">44.2 million viewers</span>. Game of Thrones managed to win
                        59 Emmy awards and broke records including being the most expensive television show made averaging
                        <span class="highlight">$15 million per episode</span> in Season 8.

                    <p>So why was Game of Thrones so popular? The first season did have a <span class="highlight">$60 million budget</span>, but you can't just throw
                        money at something and expect it to be good (Cats the movie for example). Having a multitude of fantastic actors and actresses probably helped
                        as well. <br/> <br/> But ultimately, the books that the show was based on were already well known
                        by 2011 having been on <span class="highlight">New York Times Best Seller List</span>. And for good reason too. George R. R. Martin
                        had created a well-crafted and complex world with a vast array of characters each having their own separate story.

                    <p>This all sounds good and everything, right? Wrong. There is one ultimate flaw in this. This flaw would lead
                        Game of Thrones to have its worst rated season, season 8, which has a rating of <span class="highlight">58% (critic)</span>
                        on RottenTomatoes, the only season to rate below 90%. The flaw is that George R. R. Martin has not finished the novels yet.<br/> <br/>
                        In fact, he still has <span class="highlight">two planned and unreleased novels</span>
                        in the works. So without having source material to go off of, the showrunners had to try their best to tie in all the storylines together.
                        And we saw how they went. (We're all at home, and no one is talking about rewatching Game of Thrones.)
